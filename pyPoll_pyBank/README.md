This repository is destined to hold files in order to display some of the main Data Analytical skills developed by me, Gustavo Garofalo, in the past couple of years.

Most of the skills displayed here were learned either by self studying or formal education, one of which is the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp, an intensive 24 week program offered by the University of Central Florida (Cerificate awarded in March 2020).

Python is my favourite programming language. It is an amazing tool, intuitive and the possibilities are infinite. It is a skill that I want to continuously improve.

The skill displayed in this repository is PYTHON programming.

## Background

In this challenge, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete **2** Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.
Both of these challenges encompasses a real-world situation where your newfound Python scripting skills can come in handy.

In this repo, there are two main folfers, one called "datasets" to hold the data that will be used for PyBank and PyPoll. Also a folder called "solutions", where you will find the solution for both challenges depicted below.

## PyBank

* Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

* In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. (Up until now, Uncle Cleetus had been trustfully tallying them one-by-one, but unfortunately, his concentration isn't what it used to be.)

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.


* In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
