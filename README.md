This repository is destined to hold files in order to display some of the main Data Analytical skills developed by me, Gustavo Garofalo, in the past couple of years.

Most of the skills displayed here were learned either by self studying or formal education, one of which is the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp, an intensive 24 week program offered by the University of Central Florida (Cerificate awarded in March 2020).

Python is my favourite programming language. It is an amazing tool, intuitive and the possibilities are infinite. It is a skill that I want to continuously improve. I enjoy using Python as a base for most of my data analysis, mainly: developing apps to scrape de web for information, performing api calls and usig its woderfull libraries to manipulate data, like Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.

The skill displayed in this repository is PYTHON programming.
